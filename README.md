# LBH-Wordpress-Theme

A wordpress theme for Hackney Council, inspired by GDS

  

## Build the Worpress theme Zip file

Within the hackney-council directory run

    gulp zip

This produces a file called hackney-council.zip in the root folder. Change this filename in the gulp-tasks/zip.js file for a different theme name.
