# LBH-Wordpress-Theme

  

A wordpress theme for Hackney Council, inspired by GDS

  

# Get Started

  

	npm install

  
# Build the assets
To build the CSS and JS files:

	gulp build:dist
	
# Build the Worpress theme Zip file

  

Within the hackney-council directory run:

	gulp zip

  

This produces a file called hackney-council.zip in the root folder. 

If you need a different theme name simply rename this file before uploading it to WordPress.
